The Bonsai Platform provides programmers and data scientists with a new way of
building sophisticated ML and AI applications. This API is at the core of how
programmers interact with the AI Engine.

The Bonsai BRAIN API has two feature areas:

* Managing BRAINS
* Connecting simulators for training and use.

The root for all Bonsai Platform API requests is *https://api.bons.ai*.



# Authentication

API calls must include an Authorization header. The value of this header is your [Access Key][2].

#### Headers

# User and BRAIN Status

### BRAIN Versions

BRAIN versions numerically count up each time a BRAIN is trained. There is also
a `latest` version that can be called if desired.

### BRAIN Modes

BRAIN versions have the following modes:

* **ready_to_train:** After Inkling is uploaded and successfully compiled, the
BRAIN version number is incremented. That particular version is in the
ready_to_train state. ready_to_train versions give predictions the same as or
worse than random.
* **training:** After the train command is given, the BRAIN version is
incremented and that version is in the training state. In this state the user
cannot load new Inkling into the BRAIN or restart training. The user must
cancel training to upload new Inkling.
* **trained:** If training is canceled or completed the BRAIN version is in
the trained state. Trained BRAIN versions can give predictions or receive more
training. version is NOT incremented upon training completion.

## User Status

Use GET to list all BRAINs owned by the user.
